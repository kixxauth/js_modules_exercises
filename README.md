JavaScript Module Exercises
===========================
Some simple exercises in Node.js to get to know the CommonJS module system used in Node.js a bit better. Uses the Mocha test framework with the Should vocabulary.

### Setup
If you haven't yet, install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

Then clone or download the latest version of this repository from
[GitHub](https://github.com/kixxauth/js_modules_exercises).

The actual setup is pretty simple. Assuming you have Node.js installed, just run this command in your console from within this directory:

    npm install

You should see a bunch of green and white text fly by the screen.

To run the tests any time, run this command:

    npm test

Like falling off a log. Enjoy!
